## Build
You can build this project using CMAKE
```
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. cmake -build .
```

## Usage
Using this project is very simple.
You can start by either loading a saved course or by starting a new one.
If you chose to start a new course, it will prompt you for a course name, and the rest is pretty straight forward. The menu will guide you through all the available options.

## Purpose
I made this as a fun little side project to both preview my standing in classes, but also to try making somthing useful.
